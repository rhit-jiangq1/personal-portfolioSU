        I'm Qijun Jiang, born in Beijing, China. I am going to be 20 years old. Now, I am studying in Rose-Hulman Institue of Technology and I'm a freshman majoring in CS.</p>
        <p>I find a lot of good students here, and they mostly are much better than me. I don't know whether I can get a good score or even able to graduate from here. But I'll try my best on learning. I find a lot of good students here, and they mostly are much better than me. I don't know whether I can get a good score or even able to graduate from here.
